## Handoff duty

This step declares `handoff: true`. Before writing your result envelope:
1. Write a handoff file at `artifacts/handoff-<step-id>.md` summarizing what
   the next inherit step needs to know (decisions made, constraints
   discovered, what was produced, where to find details).
2. That path IS the contract: the next inherit step reads the file by the
   path convention `artifacts/handoff-<step-id>.md`. There is no digest, no
   byte count and no envelope field to fill in — the result envelope is the
   minimal contract (outcome + output; needs_input adds question_id and
   question), so write the file and leave the envelope lean.
